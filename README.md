Rhesus template for basic Haskell app
=====================================

This is a [Rhesus](http://github.com/Neurogami/rhesus) template to generate a fairly basic Haskell application.

It contains a single-file "Hello, world" sort of "app", and a [Nemesis](http://github.com/nfjinjing/nemesis) file to help things along.
